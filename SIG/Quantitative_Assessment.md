# Problem Solving Assessment Experience :

It was a 1 hour test with 17 questions mostly focused on solving trivial puzzles and standard ( can be quite hard ) probability problems. 
The first 12/17 problems were fairly easy and just some observation would help you ace the problems a lot faster. 
I attempted around 15/17 problems and had to leave a path - counting variant of combinatorics just because I could not recall the tweak in the standard result. 
A fair time management would help a lot in the assessment ( a note for the future ). 
Let's see if I hear back from them, I might get 13 sure-shot right, with chances on the other 2, hopefully, this should be okay to get a call but I believe there 
is a great chance of solving all 17 when I am well prepared and have revised the concepts as the test was not hard at all.

THE SAMPLE QUESTIONS PDF DOES NOT HELP LOL!

* Path counting variant.
* Beggar coin problem of combinatorics.
* Coupon collector problem
* Famous probability puzzles ( standard ones that people prepare ) .
